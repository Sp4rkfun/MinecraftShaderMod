<p><b>Project Overview: </b></p>
<p>While this project was extremely interesting, it was also frustrating and time consuming. Short of writing and designing our on texture pack mod in minecraft our only option was to use open glsl to create shaders. Sadly there is little to no documentation on how the shaders work. We were forced to deconstruct many projects in order to form a greater understanding of how the Optifine addon worked. Once that was completed the three of us choose different graphical tasks that we were interested in creating and integrating. Alvin choose ambient occlusion, Alex choose god rays and sun flare, and David choose water effects. It was a struggling understanding how to integrate all the features together as there was little communication on who would use what buffers. In the end the result looked pleasing and a lot of knowledge was gained.<p/>
